  1.  If you have only one field(method()) in customer(@interface) annotation 
                declare the field(method()) name as value and directly give the value for 
                the value filed.  
                
  2. Always keep the message = "" in property file (default message)

       1. Always return false - which mean write condition for negative(should not be).
